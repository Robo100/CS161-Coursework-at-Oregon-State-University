DESCRIPTION:
Connect Four (also known as Four Up, Plot Four, Find Four, Captain's Mistress, Four in a Row, Drop Four, and Gravitrips in the Soviet Union)
is a two-player connection board game, in which the players choose a color and then take turns dropping colored discs into a seven-column, six-row
vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the
first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs. Connect Four is a solved game. The first player can always win by playing the
right moves. The game was first sold under the Connect Four trademark by Milton Bradley in February 1974.
